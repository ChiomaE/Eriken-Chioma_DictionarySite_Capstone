# What I Learned

I expanded my knowledge of vanilla Javascript. Now, I am more confident in my ability to build websites using this alone. I also apply my experience whenever I use Javascript based frameworks, such as React and Angular.

# Future Improvements

In the future, I would like to implement a framework (React, Angular) that would allow me to make the page more dynamic.
